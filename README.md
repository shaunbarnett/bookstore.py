# bookstore.py
Create a program that can be used by a bookstore clerk using SQlite. The program will allow the clerk to: 

○ add new books to the database 
○ update book information 
○ delete books from the database 
○ search the database to find a specific book.

I created a database called ebookstore and a table called books. The table has the following structure:

id -- title -- author -- qty

The program should present the user with the following menu:

1. Enter book
2. Update book
3. Delete book
4. Search books
0. Exit
